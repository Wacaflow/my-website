## Execute these instructions

# Its a  website where I could show the images and videos that are created for particular crypto twitter influencres. For example there is a card with the twitter profile info (to which i made image,gif, video) with image-intro or video-intro, I click to this card and then a user could see all the images and videos created related to this influencer.

# So Me as a creator I need to have an option to add cards for new influencers and the images and videos to the particular card. I should have an option to edit the name of the card, to add the twitter / X link to this influencer so that users could go to this link and check if this influencer really uses those images and videos on its x profile. 
So its kind of portfolio that demonstrates my works that i made for different x.com profiles.

# And there must be a pretty visible button to order the videos or images or gifs with profile's hero or main character. So that a user could click on it and there he sees the small instruction that explains that he must subsctibe to my X profile and has to write me a direct message on X where he explains what does he want and he sends me some references and maybe styles he prefers.
